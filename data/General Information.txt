A: If your pet is microchipped with up-to-date information, you are in compliance. If your pet is impounded or checked by an animal services officer, they can scan the microchip to verify ownership. This also helps if your pet is lost, as the finder can scan the chip to contact you.

Q: Is the process of microchipping safe for my pet?
A: Microchipping is considered safe. Adverse reactions are extremely rare, with less than 0.01% reported in over 4 million animals microchipped since 1996. The benefits of microchipping are significant compared to the minimal risk of a negative reaction.

Q: What should I do if my pet cannot be microchipped for medical reasons?
